# :rocket: How to Launch JobHunter on Your Computer?

## Prerequisites:

Before you can run **JobHunter** locally, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) – JavaScript runtime for running the development server.
  - You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) – Comes with Node.js by default, used for installing dependencies.
- **Git** – Version control system to clone the repository.
  - Install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
